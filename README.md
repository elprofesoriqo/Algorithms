# High School Algorithms Repository

This repository contains a collection of algorithms and solutions to various problems I encountered during high school, specifically focusing on tasks from programming competitions and informatics olympiads. The goal of this repository is to showcase my understanding of algorithmic concepts and problem-solving skills.

## Features

- **Diverse Algorithms**: A variety of algorithms covering topics such as sorting, searching, dynamic programming, graph theory, and more.
- **Competitive Programming Problems**: Solutions to problems from informatics olympiads and other competitive programming events, demonstrating practical application of algorithms.
- **Documentation**: Each algorithm is accompanied by explanations, usage examples, and, where applicable, time and space complexity analysis.

## Requirements

To run or test the algorithms, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.x or another programming language as specified in the respective algorithm files.

```bash
pip install <library-name>
